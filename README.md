### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am both a professional Software Engineer (M.Sc.) and a self taught programmer. I have worked in the software industry since 2013 December (from startups, mid-size to very large cooperations). I have been using computers since 1999 (8 years old). I taught myself programming during 2003-2005 (with no access to internet) and I have been programming ever since.
