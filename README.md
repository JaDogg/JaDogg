### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am both a professional Software Engineer (M.Sc.) and a self taught programmer. I have worked in the software industry since 2013 December (from startups, mid-size to very large cooperations). I have been using computers since 1999 (8 years old). I taught myself programming during 2003-2005 (with no access to internet) and I have been programming ever since.

##### Some projects

* `[2007]` `ro#` - an interpreter for a custom programming language https://sourceforge.net/projects/rosharp/files/
* `[2008]` `jumb` - a compiler and a runtime for a low level programming language. (It compiles to x86 and assembles with Flat assembler)
